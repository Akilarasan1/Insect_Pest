This research project focuses on the impact of insect pests on U.S. agriculture over the years. To manage these pests effectively, 
we have collected historical data on insect populations from EDDMaps and climate/weather data from CHELSA and WorldClim. 
The dataset spans multiple years, providing valuable insights to help farmers and stakeholders mitigate future insect pest problems.

In this study, we utilize Python programming, the MaxEnt machine learning model, and the ELAPID library, along with tools such as ArcGIS, OpenCV, and Rasterio.
By integrating these technologies, we aim to predict future trends in insect pest behavior and distribution. These findings will assist the agricultural community in making informed decisions,
thereby improving pest management strategies and reducing crop damage.ming language python maxent machine learning model and elapid, Arcgis tools,Opencv,rasterio, we will find future
